Every Revolution product I have tried has been a wonderful experience.  Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.  Better Than The Rest  I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.  Complimenting Flavors  Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means ""seeded apple"" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.  Brewing  I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!  Conclusion  Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. Best $20 I have ever spent (and continue to spend)!",Positive,Positive,True

AmazonFood,"You are given a review of Amazon's food products. Your task is to divide them into two classes: negative or positive, depending on the content of the review. Summary:  way too sweet, no berry/kiwi flavor, small serving.  Upon first taste, both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.  Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.  Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).  By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say ""no *added* sugar"", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying ""no sugar"" or ""no sucrose"" (table sugar).  disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.",Negative,Negative,True

I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.  Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?  As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.  I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.  My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!

Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011528S0"">Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold</a> for coffee, tea, and cooking.

Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.  Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!",Positive,Positive,True

“In his final days, he allegedly lectured on the details of concentration camps and how the ovens were too small to kill 6 million Jews,” Meyer wrote.

Joe Schmitz left the George W. Bush administration in 2005 to take the Blackwater job, a move that came after Schmitz was reportedly informed he was the focus of a congressional inquiry into whether he blocked two criminal investigations of Bush officials the year before.

Schmitz is the son of the late John G. Schmitz, the former ultraconservative congressman from Orange County, California.

As a sitting congressman, John Schmitz refused to comment after he wrote the foreword and endorsed the publication of a book that contained widely-condemned anti-Semitic propaganda and was written by a longtime member of the John Birch society.

The CD is dedicated to Derrick (the bands original drummer) and with that comes a lot of emotion, dealing a lot with reflection, moving on, and self-discovery, the lyrics here are very well crafted. I absolutly cannot stop listening to this record. It's got so much to offer. The highlights of the album for me ""Runs in the Family"", ""The Controtionist"" and ""Days of New"", which will most likley give you the chills if youre a die hard lagwagon fan.I truly belive that Joey Cape is one on the most incedible song writers of the past couple decades.

And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.

They are constantly tearing down the President and like him or not they should not say bald faced lies about him or call him names or say he's unhinged or whatever other crazy crap they have to say.  What about CNN Anderson Cooper talking about poop in pants. Why didn't every Republican Senator and Representative come out and say that was totally unprofessional and needed retracted.  Why doesn't anyone back the President and ask for an apology for all the lies supposed ""news"" outlets keep printing and saying about our President?  What 's with all the celebrities and Congressmen who used to be Trump's golf buddies or/and friends?  It seems like everyone turns on President Trump.

My wife finds it bizarre that I enjoy a good cup of joe just before I call it a night. Yeah, sometimes I get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so I thought I'd give this decaff a go. What you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it's a little weak and I recommend dropping about 50% more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor. Also, as it's vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat - nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot. I know it's a minor thing to complain about but I like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldn't even stand up. It was about 1/2"" thick!

We were going on vacation for two weeks, and I was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination. Being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk I purchase from Trader Joe's, I figured I would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him. It smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible! Words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was.  My poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it.  It smelled so bad, I couldn't even taste it myself.  Maybe we're just used to the regular brand he drinks?  My only advice, try a small amount first.  It is not returnable!!!",Negative,Negative,True
